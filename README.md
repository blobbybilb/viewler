A simple page ruler that uses the viewport based units, vw and vh. It also has marks that show where the mouse is on both rulers.

[Demo](https://viewler.pages.dev)

### Usage
Available from the chrome/edge/firefox stores. Safari version coming soon ðŸ˜¬.


### Why?
I couldn't find any other page rulers that use vw and vh (they all use pixels) so I made this. If you have any suggestions or feedback, leave a review! And if you like it, please consider leaving a positive rating so others can find this as well!
